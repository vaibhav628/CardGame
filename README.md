# CardGame
This is card game that my kids play all the time
Deck of card is split between two players. 
Players start playing one card at a time alternating till they get color match (Hearts/Hearts, Clubs/Clubs, Diamonds/Diamonds, Spades/Spades). 
Whoever gets a match, gets the winning bouty and that player starts playing cards again and they repeat till one player goes bankrupt
